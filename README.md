# MUFC2020

A repository with data and analysis of Manchester United FC's performance in the Premier League during the 2019/20 season. 

## Repository Info

The data is influenced by the data available in a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/i2d9io/premier_league_season_review_with_our_surveys/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) on [r/RedDevils: The Reddit home for Manchester United](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils), posted on August 2, 2020. 
The contents of the post are insightful. 

The purpose of this repository is for a fun personal project to recreate the orginal poster's results as well as build on it to produce more interesting graphs, tables and models. As I am most familiar with *R*, I will start my work using it. Since this repository's primary purpose is for personal enrichment, I will attempt to replicate or add to my analyses using *SAS* and *Tableau*, which are both new to me as of now (August 2, 2020).

## About Manchester United

Manchester United is a football club based Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England that are (as of August 2020) the team with the most English top flight championships, at 20, having secured 13 in the Premier League era (ie. since 1992).

## The 2019/20 Season

A most unique season, the 2019/20 Premier League campaign concluded with Manchester United finishing 3rd, behind Liverpool and Manchester City. This was also Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first full campaign as the manager of Manchester United. New singings of Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan Bissaka bolstered United's defense, and the addition of Bruno Fernandes provided the creative spark that catapulted the team to a 3rd place finish.
